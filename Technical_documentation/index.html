          JavaScript and Java are both programming languages, but they have some
          key differences. JavaScript is primarily used for client-side
          scripting in web browsers, while Java is a general-purpose programming
          language that can be used for a wide range of tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted language, while Java is a
          more powerful, compiled language. JavaScript is easier to learn and
          use, but Java has a wider range of libraries and tools available.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main similarities between the two languages is that they
          both have a similar syntax and use similar concepts such as
          object-oriented programming.
        </p>
        <code>console.log("Hello, World!"); // JavaScript</code>
        <code>System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // Java</code>

          Python is a popular, high-level programming language known for its
          readability and simplicity. It is often used for web development, data
          analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python has a large and active community, which means that there are
          many libraries and frameworks available for use. It also has a wide
          range of applications, including web development, data science, and
          machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main features of Python is its use of indentation to
          indicate code blocks, rather than curly braces or keywords. This makes
          the code easier to read and understand.
        </p>
        <code>print("Hello, World!") # Python</code>
        <code>num1 = 5</code>
        <code>num2 = 10</code>
        <code>sum = num1 + num2</code>
        <code>print("The sum is", sum)</code>

          Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites.
          It involves a variety of skills, including web design, web
          programming, and database management.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many different technologies and languages used in web
          development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Each has its
          own strengths and weaknesses, and different technologies are used for
          different tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web development can be divided into three main categories: front-end
          development, back-end development, and full-stack development.
          Front-end developers focus on the user interface and user experience,
          while back-end developers focus on the server-side logic and database
          management.

        <p>
          Database design is the process of creating a structured plan for how a
          database will be organized and used. It involves determining what data
          needs to be stored, and how that data will be organized and related to
          one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many different types of databases, including relational
          databases, NoSQL databases, and graph databases. Each has its own
          strengths and weaknesses, and different types of databases are used
          for different tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Database design is an important step in the software development
          process, as it determines how well the database will perform and how
          easily it can be maintained and updated.

        <p>
          Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates
          analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence
          that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or
          decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
